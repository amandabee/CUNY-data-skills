Data Skills is a required first semester course in CUNY's Social Journalism Masters program, which I last taught Spring 2015. 

The `gh-pages` branch of this repository feeds a [public facing site](http://amandabee.github.io/CUNY-data-skills/) that I direct students to for walk-throughs that we need in class, and for homework instructions. You may find some typos there, or room for improvement, but in general I intend those pages to be read and followed by Data Skills students. 

My own weekly notes and course plans live on the `master` branch of the [repository](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-skills/). You're welcome to read through them for a sense of how I approach planning for class, but you might find them too thin or cryptic to actually crib from. 

# cuny-data-skills
This semester we will work together to gather, analyze and visualize numbers you need to understand your audience and to tell interactive data-driven stories.
