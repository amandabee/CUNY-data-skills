Data Skills is a required first semester course in CUNY's Social Journalism Masters program, which I last taught Spring 2015. 

The `gh-pages` branch of this repository feeds a [public facing site](http://amandabee.github.io/CUNY-data-skills/) that I direct students to for walk-throughs that we need in class, and for homework instructions. You may find some typos there, or room for improvement, but in general I intend those pages to be read and followed by Data Skills students. 

My own weekly notes and course plans live on the `master` branch of the [repository](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-skills/). You're welcome to read through them for a sense of how I approach planning for class, but you might find them too thin or cryptic to actually crib from. 

You might also be interested in a few other courses that I teach or have taught: 
+ [Data-Driven Storytelling](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-storytelling/) -- a second semester class in the MA in Journalism.
+ [Digital Praxis Seminar](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-Digital-Praxis-Seminar) -- a seminar in the Digital Humanities Masters/PhD program at The Graduate Center 
+ [Fundamentals of Interactive](https://github.com/amandabee/fundamentals-of-interactive) -- a 10 week first semester class in the MA in Journalism
+ [Fundamentals of Numeracy](https://github.com/amandabee/fundamentals-of-numeracy) -- a two part lecture on writing about numbers
+ [Newsgames](https://github.com/amandabee/newsgames) -- a five week course that is secretly an introduction to coding, built around editing progressively more complex codebases.
+ [Craft II](https://github.com/amandabee/craft2) -- a very loose jumble of notes towards a handful of interactive lessions that I prepared for Craft II. This is definitely incomplete -- I always team taught this course and we didn't wind up using Github much for lesson planning. 



# cuny-data-skills
This semester we will work together to gather, analyze and visualize numbers you need to understand your audience and to tell interactive data-driven stories.
