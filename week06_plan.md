# Did you bring in data?

# Last Pass at Mapping

+ Number formats (`to_char`)
+ Framing stories

What is the takeaway? Try some headlines. 

[Kentucky's Quest to go 40-0](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/rest-easy-bob-knight-kentucky-probably-wont-finish-undefeated/)
> Probability the Windcats remain undefeated, assuming they play second day of each of first for NCAA tournament rounds

[Flashbangs Thrown in Little Rock](https://www.propublica.org/article/flashbangs) 
> It's difficult to find police departments that keep records of flashbang use. But we found that Little Rock, Ark., did note the damage done by flashbangs in SWAT team records obtained by the ACLU. Between 2011 and 2013, Little Rock police tossed flashbangs into homes on 84 percent of raids — nearly all of them in predominantly black neighborhoods.

[Do you live in one of California's pesticide hotspots?](http://apps.cironline.org/pesticides/?zoom=11&latitude=34.200340270996094&longitude=-119.18012237548828&layer=concernchems&action=area) -- let's talk about how they frame this.

[Stockpiling Vacation](http://www.revealnews.org/article/thousands-of-california-state-workers-are-hoarding-vacation-days/) -- I'm not sure the bubbles tell us much, but let's look a the framing. 
> **Stockpiling vacation** More than 35,000 California state workers have broken the state government's 80-day limit for vacation time. The circles show how many employees are over the cap in each state agency and what percent of that agency's workforce they represent, as tracked by the State Controller’s Office. 

[Handgun Sales in California](http://www.revealnews.org/article/in-california-handguns-enter-2nd-decade-of-rising-sales/) actually bothers me. Why do we have a second label on the Y Axis? We don't need it. 

Photo Captions, too.

What they don't say? "The photo above shows..." -- they do, however, tell us why we're looking at this picture. 

## One more pass. 

Revise your Gist to add framing. Give it a meaningful title, and put the bl.ocks.org URL on the assignments doc. Let's look these over. 

# Pitches

- School Safety
- Teacher Evals
- Mental Illness/Criminal Justice
- Prisoner HIV


# Visual Encoding
+ [catalog](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/)
+ [walk through](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z4krjav4qq6ber9/visual_encoding.xls?dl=0)

What do you want to show; sketch it. 

Change over time, concentration, buckets. Is this continuous?

Think about some different ways we could chart deportations.  What are our axes? 

## Charting:
+ Stick the [CSV in a gist](https://gist.github.com/amandabee/5b0cf270dfee2511a946/1d2fdc9dbd651a4a5f92001d070bc0b8c16b9d1d) and give the Raw URL to [charted](http://www.charted.co/?%7B%22dataUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Famandabee%2F5b0cf270dfee2511a946%2Fraw%2Fb6e3d84bbe73b5f5d6bc4a30cf42a2a2c26721c7%2Fcriminal_deportation.csv%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22dark%22%2C%22charts%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22line%22%7D%5D%7D). How do we need to reorganize the data? (Transpose!)

+ Replace commas with tabs in TextWrangler and use [Chartbuilder](http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/)



# Homework
As ever, I strongly encourage you to work with data you need to understand. 

Identify one data set that you can chart and chart it. That's all.
