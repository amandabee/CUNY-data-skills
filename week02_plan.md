### HW Review

+ JSON is structured data, it is just strucured ... differently. For small data sets, there are web tools. For larger ones, I can help. Ex: [DOT Outreach](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/misc/outreach_schools.json) | <https://json-csv.com/> 

### Spreadsheets
Advanced spreadsheetery (VLOOKUP, RIGHT, LEFT, TRIM)

### Publishing
