### HW Review
+ [Visual Encoding]( http://cunygsj.docutek.com/eres/coursepage.aspx?cid=166)

+ JSON is structured data, it is just strucured ... differently. For small data sets, there are web tools. For larger ones, I can help. Ex: [DOT Outreach](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/misc/outreach_schools.json) | <https://json-csv.com/> 

### Spreadsheets
Advanced spreadsheetery (VLOOKUP, RIGHT, LEFT, TRIM)

### Community profile round robin. 

In groups of four, let's outline at least two communities you'd want to profile in order to reach them. You have to form your own groups for next week. 

### Tabula

Tabula is a product of the [Open News](http://opennews.org/what/fellowships/) fellowship, which is pretty good stuff. 

Use Deron's Pew study. 

If the upload fails, go home, and then click on it. It's often there. 

### Publishing

I'm rethinking a bunch of things and ... we're going to use gists to develop our pages.
