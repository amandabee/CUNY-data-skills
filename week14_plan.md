# Coaching

Use it!

Deb Stead said something that stuck with me, eons ago. I can't quote her precisely, but basically she pointed ouat that the way we learn to write in college is based on a totally archaic notion that college students are mostly on a path to academic careers. Everything you learn about writing prepares you to write for academia and the first thing you have to do when you leave school is learn how to write to communicate. Write like a normal person. And, perhaps, write like a journalist. Academia encourages all kinds of bullshit puffery

# Tidying

I was scattered last week as we worked through our HTML challenges. Let's do a few things:

+ Take the anchors off your Imagur graphics
+ Fix your page titles
+ Pull you section headers ("Introduction")
