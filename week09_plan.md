# Cut to the chase
Everyone (alone) write a haiku about your story. 5-7-5. What's the most important thing? The essence? 

# Surveys
Make a google survey.

Look at the results in a spreadsheet. 

Think about how much you actually need to know. 


# Spreadsheet Funtimes
U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Administration for Children & Families publishes state by state data on child welfare outcomes, including time to adopt. For those children who are adopted out of foster care, how long do they spend *in* care first? 

I pulled out some 2013 [data](http://amandabee.github.io/CUNY-data-skills/assets/adoption_timeframe.csv) for us to play with. 

What's the national average?
+ Break out a small chunk. Get a raw number and give that as a percent of the whole. 
Are you comfortable with what the figures are doing? 


What's the halfway point? How long does it take for at least half of the kids in care to be adopted?
