# Cut to the chase
Everyone (alone) write a haiku about your story. 5-7-5. What's the most important thing? The essence?

# Surveys
Make a google survey; Look at the results in a spreadsheet; Think about how much you actually need to know. 

We're doing this light. 

Some things we should be clear on: a real survey is a random sample. 

But, asking what people think is a great way to engage an audience and build a better and more diverse network of sources. 

So ... let's look at [some examples](http://freegreentea.info/talks/numeracy/#/12).

(A [newer poll](http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/12/03/poll-should-horse-drawn-carriages-be-banned/) brought in tens of thousands of votes).

[The Public Insight Network](https://www.publicinsightnetwork.org/about/) is more complex than it looks on its face, but they tell a great story about networks, that starts in Jan 2009, when [US Airways Flight 1549](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549) [made an emergency landing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549#/media/File:Plane_crash_into_Hudson_River_%28crop%29.jpg) in the Hudson River. WNYC, and a few other news outlets reporting on the crash landing had a box in their sidebar inviting folks to join the Public Insight Network and/or asking for folks who work in aviation to explain how something like this happens. Ultimately, PIN wasn't integral to unravelling that mystery, but it meant that the network was now stocked with a lot of folks who work in aviation. Fast forward almost a year: two hours after leaving San Diego, NW Airlines Flight 188 [lost contact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Airlines_Flight_188) with air traffic control. 20 minutes after the flight was supposed to have landed, Air Traffic Controllers finally got ahold of the pilots who were 100 miles past Minneapolis. 

A lot of newsrooms were trying to figure out *what happened*, especially since the FAA was not being particularly forthcoming. Finally, someone (I think it was MPR, but I can't swear to that) sent a query out to the Public Insight Network: "What should we be asking?" and got the same response from lots and lots of folks who work in aviation: The pilots were probably distracted, checking Facebook or email. Et voila: on direct questioning in a press conference we learned that the pilots were checking email ([schedules, they said](http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/10/26/airliner.flyby/index.html)).

Without that specialized network, we might not have gotten the story out of the FAA.

# Spreadsheet Funtimes
U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Administration for Children & Families publishes state by state data on child welfare outcomes, including time to adopt. For those children who are adopted out of foster care, how long do they spend *in* care first? 

I pulled out some 2013 [data](http://amandabee.github.io/CUNY-data-skills/assets/adoption_timeframe.csv) for us to play with. 

What's the national average?
+ Break out a small chunk. Get a raw number and give that as a percent of the whole. 
Are you comfortable with what the figures are doing? 


What's the halfway point? How long does it take for at least half of the kids in care to be adopted?
