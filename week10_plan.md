# Show and Tell

Let's look at what you've got.

# Don't hate me

But I'm going to show you github now. 

Gists are quick and dirty. Which is handy, but 

+ Git is version control and collaboration software
+ your "gist" actually is a repository, but there are no built in tools for managing collaborators. 

You can choose to make a gist public or keep it private. Even with a free account. A github repository is always public unless you've paid money for (or they made a mess of your life and tried to make it better by giving you) a premium account. That's one of the reasons I didn't start us out here. I want you to be thinking about whether or not you want to make your work public.
