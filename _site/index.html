<p>It isn’t hypberbole: journalists today have access to more data than ever before, as well as to better tools to understand that data and retell the stories it holds. Whether you want to understand your own audience better, measure the impact of efforts to expand your reach, or just tell stories about the impact of policy, a little bit of data can go a long way, <em>if</em> you have the skills to put data to use.  </p>

<p>This semester we will work together to gather, analyze and visualize numbers you need to understand your audience and to tell interactive data-driven stories. </p>

<p>We’ll look at the data that helps us <em>listen</em> to audiences – who are they and what are they asking? We’ll <em>gather</em> data that can help answer those questions, <em>interrogate</em> the data to make sure we have clear and realiable answers, and we’ll <em>present</em> that data in clear engaging stories and reports. </p>

<p>We’ll use Excel (or LibreOffice’s Calc) and some command-line tools like CSVkit to dig into numbers and we’ll use web-based tools such as CartoDB and HighCharts to create maps and charts that clearly illustrate your findings. You’ll pick up a little HTML, CSS and jQuery along the way – just enough to show off your work online. This is not a course in coding, but programmers of all skill levels are welcome.</p>

<p>Note: this class will go deep on some data analysis tools, such as spreadsheets, that you will be expected to master. We will aslo introduce more complex advanced tools that you won’t master in a semester. </p>

<h2 id="about-the-faculty">About the Faculty</h2>

<p><strong>Amanda Hickman</strong> works at the intersection of journalism and civic engagement, and especially values reporting that makes it easier for individuals to participate in democratic processes. As program director at DocumentCloud, she helped reporters around the world analyze, annotate, and publish primary source documents. Amanda managed development of a series of games about public policy issues as Gotham Gazette‘s director of technology. She has spent more than a decade reporting on local and international events and working directly with community based organizations to understand, and draw their membership into, the political process. Amanda has taught at Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, NYU’s Gallatin School and CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.</p>

<h2 id="software-requirements">Software Requirements</h2>

<p>We’ll be using a handfull of <a href="https://fsf.org/">free</a> and open source software tools this semester and a few that are just free of charge: </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tabula.nerdpower.org/">Tabula</a> allows you to extract structured data from PDFs</li>
  <li><a href="http://openrefine.org/">Open Refine</a> is indispensable for cleaning messy data</li>
  <li>CUNY recommends Fetch for FTP, but we’re going to use <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a> </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> is indispensible, as is the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/">Web Developer Toolbar</a> add on. </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> ought to be installed on your computer already. We’ll use it to install <a href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/">CSVkit</a>, a command-line tool that lets you investigate data in comma delimited text files. </li>
  <li><a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a> is a handy cost-free OSX app that makes basic HTML markup easy, without tempting you to get fussy with layout. Linux users can get much of what Mou offers from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/retext/">ReText</a>, which is free. </li>
</ul>

<p>You <a href="http://tech.journalism.cuny.edu/documentation/software-installation/">should</a> already have <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> and Excel installed. You’ll need both. If you don’t have Excel, you can also use <a href="http://libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice Calc</a> for all our spreadsheet work. </p>

<p>You will need to create accounts on <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">JS Fiddle</a>, <a href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> and <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange GIS</a>. <em>Important!</em> Before you create your CartoDB account, make sure you have the information you need to get the student discount. Their standard free option is not adequate to our needs and upgrading is much more difficult than using the discount in the first place. </p>

<h2 id="major-assignments">Major Assignments</h2>

<p>Students will work in pairs to complete two major assignments. In addition, regular homework exercises will reinforce skills we’ve learned in class.</p>

<p>Assignments will be timed to allow you to dig deeper into your work in Information and Communities and your reporting course. You will complete two major assignments: one a community profile, the other a reported data-driven story. Students will work in pairs on the two major assignments and will develop a compelling pitch, a clear storyboard, a comprehensive rough draft and a complete final piece for each. </p>

<h3 id="community-profile-guidelines">Community Profile Guidelines</h3>

<p>We have ready access to rich and varied data about communities of all shapes, whether those communities are joined by geography, interests, heritage, age or a combination of all of those. We’ll use that data add quantitative understanding to what you already know about a community. </p>

<p>Students will work in pairs to compile a portfolio of data about a single community, based primarily on publicly available data, though where appropriate students are welcome to incorporate proprietary intelligence. Identify at least eight salient characteristics (is income relevant? educational attainment? is this community anchored in a single location or geographically dispersed?) and points of comparison (neighboring communities, for instance, in the case of a geographically-based community), and find data to quantify those characteristics. </p>

<p>Your final product will be a short report that describes the community in numbers and puts those numbers in context. </p>

<h3 id="data-driven-story-guidelines">Data Driven Story Guidelines</h3>

<p>Just how many hospitals have closed in New York State in the last two years? Where were they and who was impacted? Do low-income New Yorkers have better access to fresh produce than they did ten years ago? Can they walk to green markets? Where are the most dangerous intersections in New York City? How many of them are near schools? These are all examples of questions we can answer with data that is already accessible to the public. </p>

<p>For the data driven story, students will work in pairs to identify newsworthy data, pitch and report a story of no more than 600 words that includes at least two visualizations of that data. The story should have news value and the reporters should demonstrate a clear understanding of the data and its limitations. Students should speak with as many experts as necessary to write responsibly about these numbers. </p>

<h2 id="absences-and-tardiness">Absences and Tardiness</h2>

<p>Participation and attendance are required and are important to your success in the class. This is a fast moving, skills based class. We’ll be tackling new tools every week and it will be very, very difficult to get caught up if you miss class. </p>

<p>Please be on time for class and back to class from breaks.     </p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>Your grade is determined by three factors: active participation in class, homework assignments, and the two major team assignments. </p>

<p>This means that if you complete a brilliant story or profile but don’t put real effort into your pitch or rough draft, you can’t get better than a C on the story.</p>

<p><strong>Pitches:</strong> <a id="pitch"></a> A complete pitch should tell me who cares, why we care now, and what pre-reporting you’ve done. You must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a proposed title or headline  </li>
  <li>a story slug – up to three words that capture the essence of your story</li>
  <li>a list of the story’s key elements  </li>
  <li>a news hook, or explanation of why this story matters now  </li>
  <li>a description of and link to the data (which means you have to find your data!)  </li>
  <li>For your reporting piece: one source you have already spoken with or at least three potential expert sources and your plans for reaching them</li>
  <li>For your community profile: propose at least ten data points you’d like to work with and explain why each is relevant.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Storyboards:</strong> <a id="storyboard"></a> A storyboard organizes your content conceptually and spatially. This semester, when you turn in storyboards, you should also include a revised pitch and a proposed nut graf. Your nut graf will change your story develops, but it should capture all of the main elements of your story. </p>

<p>We use wireframe and storyboards interchangeably here. We’re looking for a simple sketch (on paper, in Word, or PowerPoint, Illustrator, or any number of online storyboarding tools) that shows us how you intend to integrate your visualizations, words, and navigation elements. Use simple boxes to tell us where your different elements will be positioned in a design, and how a user will navigate through the content. Check out <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/10000words/the-importance-of-sketching-and-why-you-should-be-doing-it_b837">Mark Luckie’s thoughts on sketching/storyboarding</a>, with examples, from 10,000 Words. </p>

<p><strong>Rough Drafts:</strong> <a id="roughdraft"></a> A rough draft does not have to have the polish of a final project, but it should be close. You should have created the visualizations that you plan to use. Your classmates should be able to evaluate a rough draft on its merits, without a guided tour of forthcoming features. A complete rough draft includes: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Clean data in spreadsheets, already normalized, sorted, manipulated  </li>
  <li>Visualizations of the data with labeled axes  </li>
  <li>Captions  </li>
  <li>Credits  </li>
  <li>A headline  </li>
  <li>For your reporting piece: at least three links to other reporting that puts your story in a broader context.  </li>
  <li>Introductory text that includes information gleaned from at least one human source.  </li>
  <li>For your reporting piece: A source list</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Final Story:</strong> <a id="finalstory"></a>Your story must be uploaded to digital storage. Post an excerpt and a link to the class blog.  </p>

<h2 id="plagiarism-and-copyright">Plagiarism and Copyright</h2>

<p>It is a serious ethical violation to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Any such plagiarism will result in serious disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the CUNY J-School. <em>Plagiarism</em> may involve copying text from a book or magazine without attributing the source, or lifting words, code, photographs, videos, or other materials from the Internet and attempting to pass them off as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about how to distinguish between acceptable research and plagiarism.</p>

<p>In addition to being a serious academic issue, <em>copyright</em> is a serious legal issue.</p>

<p>Never “lift” or “borrow” or “appropriate” or “repurpose” graphics, audio, or code without both permission and attribution. This applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, and it includes images found online and in books.</p>

<p>Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the public domain or shared via a creative commons license that allows derivative works, or use images from the AP Photo Bank or which the school has obtained licensing.</p>

<p>If you’re repurposing code, be sure to keep the original licensing intact. If you’re not sure how to credit code, ask.</p>

<p>The exception to this rule is fair use: if your story is about the image itself, it is often acceptable to reproduce the image. If you want to better understand fair use, the <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide">Citizen Media Law Project</a> is an excellent resource. &lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>When in doubt: ask.   </p>
