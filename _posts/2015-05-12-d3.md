# So you want to use D3?

[D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) is a powerful javascript library that lets you draw vector graphics on the fly.

## Vector v. Rastor

What, is a vector graphic?

In [geometry a vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector) is anything with length (or magnitude) and direction. So what does that mean for graphics? Look it up!

A [raster graphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) on the other hand is more of a pixel map. It does a great job of capturing the information in a photograph, with shading and nuance, but it isn't a very efficient way to define a sold blue bar, for instance.

This is *way* oversimplified, but it is still a useful starting point. `png`, `gif` and `jpeg` are all raster formats, but they encode information differently. Whole other conversation.

## D3 draws Vector Graphics

We just want to make a [basic chart](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery#basic-charts), probably a basic [bar chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887051) to start with.

Note: you're actually seeing a pretty cool feature of [bl.ocks](http://bl.ocks.org) that we haven't much touched on. Look at how it treats a file called `Readme.md`. Neat, huh?

But let's take a look at these pieces. The easiest way to start with any new tool is to take something that already works, and tweak it.  So let's do that:

+ Fork [Bostock's Demo](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/3887051) on gist
+ Edit the Read Me -- put something in there about who you are and what you're up to.
+ Swap out the data. Use Rachel and Pedro's [deferred action eligibility data]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/eligible_immigrants.csv) instead.
+ Check it out in <bl.ocks.org> -- we've obviously got some work to do. Because we've all worked out that gist and bl.ocks have a hard time staying in sync, we're going to work locally. So your next step is to...
+ Open your terminal
+ Clone your gist with `git clone git@gist.github.com:/c956853b0904e30d13e3.git` (but ... use your gist, not mine!) Get the exact string you need by looking for the `HTTPS clone URL` and toggling it to `SSH clone URL`.
+ Find that folder and open `index.html` in a text editor. And a web browser. You're going to toggle between these.
+ <kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd>, to save <kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>tab</kbd> to switch windows  <kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>r</kbd> to reload. You'll work so much faster once you get that down.

Bostock is doing some proof of concept stuff here. You'll notice he doesn't have a `<head>` on his page, for instance. We'll leave that for now, and focus on getting the chart itself working. But don't take too much of a lead from him.

+ Walk through the original code and let's look at what it is doing.
+ Look at line 60. What does `return key !== "State";` mean? (Hint: look back at his original data)
+ Where is this chart calling on information by state? Talking about ages? Let's rename those variables.
+ How would you swap the colors out to get Pedro and Rachel's Yellow and Red? Use the element instructor to find those colors. <span class="hide">#CC3635 and #FFD200</span>.

When you're done, you can walk through [another bar chart tutorial](http://www.d3noob.org/2014/02/making-bar-chart-in-d3js.html) or start working your way through [an actual book](https://leanpub.com/D3-Tips-and-Tricks/read) about D3.

Or, take a look at his [stacked multiples](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4679202) demo and make that your next project.

Note: there are a few [not bad](http://www.d3-generator.com/) tools [out there](http://phrogz.net/JS/d3-playground/#BlankDefault) that can help you put together a D3 chart, but eventually you're going to have to start learning javascript if you want real control.
