# So you want to use D3?

[D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) is a powerful javascript library that lets you draw vector graphics on the fly.

## Vector v. Rastor

What, is a vector graphic?

In [geometry a vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector) is <span class="hide">anything with length (or magnitude) and direction</span>. So what does that mean for graphics?

A [raster graphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) on the other hand is more of a pixel map. It does a great job of capturing the information in a photograph, with shading and nuance, but it isn't a very efficient way to define a sold blue bar, for instance.

This is *way* oversimplified, but it is still a useful starting point. `png`, `gif` and `jpeg` are all raster formats, but they encode information differently. Whole other conversation.
