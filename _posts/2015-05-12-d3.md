# So you want to use D3?

[D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) is a powerful javascript library that lets you draw vector graphics on the fly.

## Vector v. Rastor

<div class="pull-right col-lg-2">

<img src="/CUNY-data-skills/assets/sandy_dog.jpg" alt="Sandy Dog Loves Beach" title="That's Bear" class="img-responsive" />

<img src="/CUNY-data-skills/assets/sandy_dog_zoom.jpg" alt="Zoom Way In" title="That's Bear" class="img-responsive" /> </p>



</div>

What, is a vector graphic?

In [geometry a vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector) is <span class="hide">anything with length (or magnitude) and direction</span>. So what does that mean for graphics?

A [raster graphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) on the other hand is more of a pixel map. It does a great job of capturing the information in a photograph, with shading and nuance, but it isn't a very efficient way to define a sold blue bar, for instance.

This is *way* oversimplified, but it is still a useful starting point. `png`, `gif` and `jpeg` are all raster formats, but they encode information differently. Whole other conversation.

## D3 draws Vector Graphics

We just want to make a [basic chart](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery#basic-charts), probably a basic [bar chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887051) to start with.

Note: you're actually seeing a pretty cool

Note: there are a few [not bad](http://www.d3-generator.com/) tools [out there](http://phrogz.net/JS/d3-playground/#BlankDefault)
