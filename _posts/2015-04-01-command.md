# Command Line Basics

We're going to use a bunch of command line tools next week.  

## Looking Better
Before we do more, go ahead and look under `Terminal > Preferences` and set the default to "Homebrew" -- you can fuss with that on your own later if you'd like a different color scheme.

## For Starters

The [csvkit installation instructions](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) are probably way over your head. If they aren't, go ahead and install csvkit. If they are (or if you don't have much command line experience) ...

Read the [preface](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/preface.html), [introduction](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/introduction.html) and [first chapter](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex1.html) of Zed Shaw's [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

Go ahead and work your way up to [Chapter 7](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex7.html). If you get stuck or frustrated, you can [post an issue](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-skills/issues) and stop. If you hit a wall or get frustrated, [file an issue](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-skills/issues) explaining how you got to where you are and what is frustrating.  Keep our guide to [asking good questions]({{ site.baseurl }}/hands-on/goodquestions.html) in mind. 

Otherwise ... get through to Chapter 7. And then install CSVkit!

## Installing CSVkit 
So far, we've been using built-in shell commands. But I want everyone to do this `which pip` -- if you get a path like `/usr/bin/pip` that means that `pip` is on your computer. If you get an error or another command prompt, you must log in to a lab computer and we'll troubleshoot your computer later.

Then do `pip install --user csvkit` -- if you had admin privs on this machine you could install it everywhere, but the `--user` flag means you're only installing it for you.

## Installing CSVKit

I wrote a [tutorial on installing CSVkit](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-SOJ-data-storytelling/wiki/Tutorial:-Installing-CSVKit) that gives you a bunch of different options. I've heard that's a great place to start. 

The [csvkit installation instructions](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.1/install.html) tell you to run `pip install csvkit`. They call that simple. It *is* simple if you have `pip` installed and know what it is. But if you don't, we need to take a few steps back.

`csvkit` is a python package, `pip` is a [package manager for Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_%28package_manager%29) and python, is a programming language. So what you actually need to do is...

### First: make sure `python` is installed.

Start by running `which python` or `python --version` -- that ought to give you a clue about whether or not you've got python running already. Some versions of OSX ship with python pre-installed. 

Python-Guide has great instructions for getting started on [Windows](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/) or [OSX](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/).

Jue Yang's [walk through](https://github.com/jueyang/know-your-tools) on getting setup is another good place to start. 

### Second: make sure `pip` is installed.

If you have python but not homebrew, you'll start with `easy_install pip` (or possibly `sudo easy_install pip`). If you went the homebrew route, `brew install pip` should do it. 

### Third: install `csvkit`. 

Now try running `pip install csvkit` -- if you still get an error, it is time to [ask for help](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-skills/issues).
