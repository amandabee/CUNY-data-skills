**Pre-pitches:** Identify three datasets that interest you. Write a short blog post that describes the provenance of the data (who maintains it?), where the data can be found (include a link) and in less than 200 words each, explain why the data is interesting. This can be data that gives context to the community you're working in, or data that is worth doing some reporting on. 

Post these pre-pitches to the `dataskills-class` tumblr. .
