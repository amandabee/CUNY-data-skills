## Rough Draft: Data Driven Stories
Rough Drafts for your data driven story are due April 22. 

Your rough draft can be in github pages or a gist, as you wish, but the gist or repository should include...

+ Your original pitch in one file, as either `pitch.md` or `pitch.html`
+ Your original storyboard in a second file, `storyboard.md` or `storyboard.html`
+ Your source list, in `sources.md` or `sources.html`
+ And, of course, your rough draft in `index.html` 


## Jue Has Questions
Jue Yang is going to spend some time talking through what's going to happen in her class this summer, just to keep you guys thinking about how you want to get the most out of it. She has questions that she'll be sending out, so keep an eye out for those.
