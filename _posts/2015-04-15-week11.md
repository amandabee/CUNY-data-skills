## Rough Draft: Data Driven Stories
Rough Drafts for your data driven story are due April 22. 

Your rough draft can be in github pages or a gist, as you wish, but the gist or repository should include...

+ Your original pitch in one file, as either `pitch.md` or `pitch.html`
+ Your original storyboard in a second file, `storyboard.md` or `storyboard.html`
+ Your source list, in `sources.md` or `sources.html`
+ And, of course, your rough draft in `index.html`
