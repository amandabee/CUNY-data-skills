This week your major task is going to be pitching your data driven story. 


## Pitches

In contrast to your community profile, your data driven story should be current and newsworthy and you only need 2-3 data sources. 

A few examples under my [wheelhouse](http://dataskills.tumblr.com/tagged/wheelhouse) tag, or Greg David's [Crains column](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20150204/BLOGS01/150209929/states-stubborn-gender-pay-gap), [Claire Cain Miller's *Upshot* posts](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/claire_cain_miller/index.html?action=click&contentCollection=The%20Upshot&module=Byline&region=Header&pgtype=article) on topics like [the geography of unemployment](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/upshot/more-new-jobs-are-in-city-centers-while-employment-growth-shrinks-in-the-suburbs.html) and [the role of gender in student evaluations](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/upshot/is-the-professor-bossy-or-brilliant-much-depends-on-gender.html). Look around at [Five Thirty Eight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/rest-easy-bob-knight-kentucky-probably-wont-finish-undefeated/). [iQuant NY](http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/107245431809/how-software-in-half-of-nyc-cabs-generates-5-2) has some neat entries, that are closer than anything else to the length we're looking for. 

Work with a partner, post your pitch as a Gist and add the URL to the [class assignments page](https://docs.google.com/a/journalism.cuny.edu/document/d/1kUg2EfTBZsK0HG5TAenIa68_d9B6Od6uO6B_BRch0SE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Community Profile Data
We're going to start playing with charting tools next week so keep working on getting data (not PDF images of data...) that you'll use in your profile, and bring at least two tables that are already in spreadsheets to class. 

## Maps
Clean up your map. Add tidy hover windows, give it a title and subtitle with some context and embed it in an HTML Gist.
