#Read

Read selections from Tufte, *Quantitative Display of Information*: pages 91-105, 176-190. (available on [ereserve](http://cunygsj.docutek.com/eres/coursepage.aspx?cid=166), pass is `dataviz15`).

#Do

## Storyboards
Work with your partner to storyboard out your Data Driven Story pitch. Use a Bootstrap template and work together to get at least one actual chart or map into the Storyboard. Add your storyboard URL to the [assignments document](https://docs.google.com/a/journalism.cuny.edu/document/d/1kUg2EfTBZsK0HG5TAenIa68_d9B6Od6uO6B_BRch0SE/edit?usp=sharing). 

## Chart 
Take another pass at charting data you need for one of your current projects. Use Charted, RAW or [ChartBuilder](http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/), and add it to an HTML Gist, with a title, source and a few lines that give it context and tell the reader what you see in these numbers.

Add your `bl.ocks` URL to the [assignments document](https://docs.google.com/a/journalism.cuny.edu/document/d/1kUg2EfTBZsK0HG5TAenIa68_d9B6Od6uO6B_BRch0SE/edit?usp=sharing).
