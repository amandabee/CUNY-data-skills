#Read

Read Cairo: *The Functional Art,* Reading part 3: pages 73-86, on presentation (availabel on [ereserve](http://cunygsj.docutek.com/eres/coursepage.aspx?cid=166), pass is `dataviz15`).

#Write

Huddle with your partner and make some progress on your data driven story. What do you have? What do you need? 

#Do

Make at least one chart in either [Charted](https://medium.com/data-lab/introducing-charted-15161b2cd71e), [RAW](http://app.raw.densitydesign.org/) or [ChartBuilder](http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/) and add it to a gist with a title and a few lines of context. I recommend picking something you're going to need for one of the two stories you're working on, but it is really entirely up to you. 

Keep our class discussion in mind. Not "the chart below shows the number of people from each country in the northern triangle who were deported last year" but "Deportations to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras spiked in 2013, and the following Spring young children began appearing unaccompanied at the US border." 

Tell me what you see in the numbers. What is my takeaway?
