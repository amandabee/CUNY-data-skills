#Do

## Map
Revise your map one last time. Give it an engaging title and a caption that gives your readers a handle on what you see in the data. Why are we looking at this map? Use my [HTML Template](https://gist.github.com/amandabee/e3cb09922a9a7faf9dde) to wrap a bit of HTML around the texts, and then find your [bl.ocks](http://bl.ocks.org/amandabee/e3cb09922a9a7faf9dde) URL. If the preview is cutting off the data, try the [raw](http://bl.ocks.org/amandabee/raw/e3cb09922a9a7faf9dde/) version (there's a linke, "Open in New Window" to help you find your way to it.) Make sure that the *bl.ocks* URL is on the [assignments document](https://docs.google.com/a/journalism.cuny.edu/document/d/1kUg2EfTBZsK0HG5TAenIa68_d9B6Od6uO6B_BRch0SE/edit?usp=sharing). 
## Chart
Make at least one chart in [ChartBuilder](http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/) and add it to a gist with a title and a few lines of context. I recommend picking something you're going to need for one of the two stories you're working on, but it is really entirely up to you. 

Keep our class discussion in mind. Not "the chart below shows the number of people from each country in the northern triangle who were deported last year" but "Deportations to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras spiked in 2013, and the following Spring young children began appearing unaccompanied at the US border." 

Tell me what you see in the numbers. What is my takeaway? 

Note: if you can't figure out how to get an image all the way onto a Gist, upload it to [Imagur](http://imgur.com/) and post the Imgur URL to the [class assignments document](https://docs.google.com/a/journalism.cuny.edu/document/d/1kUg2EfTBZsK0HG5TAenIa68_d9B6Od6uO6B_BRch0SE/edit?usp=sharing).
