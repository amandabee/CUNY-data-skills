All assignments are due by 3 PM the Tuesday before class.

I'm always accessible on Tuesdays until 3PM, so don't hestitate to ask for help. 


## Keep spreadsheeting
Filter [NYC's 311 call data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9?) to include only Noise complaints from 2014. (Use `Complaint Type`, `starts with` and "Noise"; then add a second filter for `Created Date` between January 1, 2014 and January 1, 2015.)

Play around with it and post *something* interesting to the tumblr, tagged `311 assignment`.

## Pitches
We'll be working in pairs on community profiles. 

> Students will work in pairs to compile a portfolio of data about a single community, based primarily on publicly available data, though where appropriate students are welcome to incorporate proprietary intelligence. Identify at least eight salient characteristics (is income relevant? educational attainment? is this community anchored in a single location or geographically dispersed?) and points of comparison (neighboring communities, for instance, in the case of a geographically-based community), and find data to quantify those characteristics.

> Your final product will be a short report that describes the community in numbers and puts those numbers in context. 

What am I looking for in a pitch?

> Pitches: A complete pitch should tell me who cares, why we care now, and what pre-reporting you’ve done. You must include:
    a proposed title or headline
    a slug – up to three words that capture the essence of your profile
    a list of the defining characteristics of this community
    For your community profile: propose at least ten data points you’d like to work with and explain why each is relevant.

Start organizing your data. 

Create a [Github gist](https://gist.github.com/) of your pitch (Public or Secret is up to you) and post it to the [assignments document](https://docs.google.com/a/journalism.cuny.edu/document/d/1kUg2EfTBZsK0HG5TAenIa68_d9B6Od6uO6B_BRch0SE/edit?usp=sharing). Follow my format. If you decide to use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus) to format your document, be sure the name has a `.md` extension.
