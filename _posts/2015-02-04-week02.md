All assignments are due by 3 PM the Tuesday before class.

I'm always accessible on Tuesdays until 3PM, so don't hestitate to ask for help. 


## Keep spreadsheeting
Filter NYC's 311 call data to include only Noise complaints from 2014. (Use `Complaint Type`, `starts with` and "Noise"; then add a second filter for `Created Date` between January 1, 2014 and January 1, 2015.)

Play around with it and post *something* interesting to the tumblr, tagged `311 assignment`.
