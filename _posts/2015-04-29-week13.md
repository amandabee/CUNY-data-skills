# TL;DR
You have nothing due on May 6. 

#Deadline Shuffle

You have until noon on Friday to re-work your *data driven stories* that were due today. That isn't an arbitrary deadline, that's when I know I plan to sit down and grade them. 

You then get to take one last pass at each story, to fix typos and layout issues. Those *last chance revisions* are all due (on both stories) on May 12, which is our last class.

# HTML and CSS
Run your story through an [HTML validator](http://validator.w3.org/). Spend some time cleaning up the HTML add `alt` attributes to your images (hint: the existing attributes probably include `src` and `title` -- use those as a template for a new attribute called `alt`.) If there's something that's been kind of frustrating you about your page layout, let me know and I can help you clean it up. 

Try also running your HTML through a [tidier](https://infohound.net/tidy/) which will fix all your indentation and might help you flag stray closing div tags (`</div>`) that are cracking up your layout. 

Some tips, including things I didn't realize until I stopped yammering at you, are now on a lovely [HTML and CSS post]({{ site.baseurl }}/hands-on/html.html). Work with what's there or send me a note describing your particular problem, but let's get all our citations styled as citations, and our page layouts looking clean.
