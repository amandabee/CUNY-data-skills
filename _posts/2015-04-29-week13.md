#Deadline Shuffle

You have until noon on Friday to re-work your *data driven stories* that were due today. That isn't an arbitrary deadline, that's when I know I plan to sit down and grade them. 

You then get to take one last pass at each story, to fix typos and layout issues. Those *last chance revisions* are all due (on both stories) on May 12, which is our last class.

# HTML
Run your story through an [HTML validator](http://validator.w3.org/).

# CSS
Some tips, including things I didn't realize until I stopped yammering at you, are now on a lovely [HTML and CSS post]({{ site.baseurl }}/hands-on/html.html)
