In past semesters, I've done a lot with [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) but increasingly newsrooms are moving to SVG charts, and they're doing it for reasons. So we'll do it with them.

## Charting Tools:
Most newsrooms are building thigns in [D3](http://d3js.org/) which is more than we can do this semester. What we can do is get to at least clean charts using ...

+ [Charted](http://www.charted.co)
+ QZ's [Chartbuilder](http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/)
+ [RAW](http://app.raw.densitydesign.org/) for flat graphics to edit in illustrator

We're going to start our charting with these.
