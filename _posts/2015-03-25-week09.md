## Community Profile Final
Take another pass at your story and clean it up. If you're stuck, confused, frustrated, exasperated ... ask for help! I can help. Coaches can help. 

Rename your rough draft as `rough_draft.html` and put your final story at `index.html`.

## Survey Excercise
Write a short survey about something connected to either your data driven story or your community profile. Post the survey to a Gist. If you *also* want to include it on your story, that's great, but please do hand in a gist that is just the survey itself, with a bit of context to make sense of it.
