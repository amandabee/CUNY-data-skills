## Community Profile Final
Take another pass at your story and clean it up. If you're stuck, confused, frustrated, exasperated ... ask for help! I can help. Coaches can help. 

Rename your rough draft to `roughdraft.html` and put your final story at `index.html`.

Put your source list in a separate file, `sources.md` or `sources.html`. 

Remember: you are not required to include a human source for this profile but you do need to incorporate **at least three links** that put the data in a broader context and you need to provide a list of sources, whether those are reports or people. 

## Survey Excercise
Write a short survey about something connected to either your data driven story or your community profile. Post the survey to a Gist. If you *also* want to include it on your story, that's great, but please do hand in a gist that is just the survey itself, with a bit of context to make sense of it.
