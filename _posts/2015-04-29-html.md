We didn't talk much about [the difference between "block level" elements and "inline" elements](http://www.impressivewebs.com/difference-block-inline-css/), but if I'd spent more time prepping for our HTML adventure today I would have been ready to. I figured out after I stopped lecturing that the problem was that `<cite>` is an *inline* element. Which means we can tweak the font and color and background, but not the alignment or the line height. To control alignment, we need a *block level* element, like a `<div>` or a `<p>`. So `<div class="text-right">...</div>` works just fine to implement [Bootstrap's alignment class](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-alignment). Or we can control the alignment ourselves by by referencing a class, say `<div class="citation">...</div>` and then defining that class:

```css
<style>
   .citation {
       text-align: right;
    }
</style>
```

You should also take a look at the [Bootstrap](git_and_bootstrap.html) post.
