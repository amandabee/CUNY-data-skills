#Install
If you haven't already [installed csvkit](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-SOJ-data-storytelling/wiki/Tutorial:-Installing-CSVKit), start by [installing it](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-SOJ-data-storytelling/wiki/Tutorial:-Installing-CSVKit)

# Walk-thru 1: DOB Complaints

# Walk-thru 2: MapPLUTO

NYC's Department of City Planning publishes incredibly useful [property maps of NYC](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/applbyte.shtml). Not for nothing, these are available on Socrata, but if you find them on NYC Open Data you're way (way) better off going back to the agency that provides the data. Among other things, City Planning provides clear context for their data.

Today the link for the most up to date MapPLUTO data is <http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/dwn_pluto_mappluto.shtml> but that may change. Download the CSV format. You'll see why in a moment.

## Set Up For Command Line

For everyone's sanity, I'd like everyone to use **the same** file and folder names. So ...

1. Download the data (or copy it from Baker)
2. Make a folder called "pluto"
3. Move the data into that folder and unzip it
4. Open a terminal from that folder. 

# Command Line Basics

We're going to use a bunch of command line tools to work with these files. 

## Vanity
Before we do more, go ahead and look under `Terminal > Preferences` and set the default to "Homebrew" -- you can futz with that on your own later if you'd like a different color scheme.

## Getting Around
You don't actually have to launch the terminal from the folder every time -- but since you can, we're not going to walk through that part (though if you want to do more with this, I recommend [Zed Shaw](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/).)

+ `ls` should show you a list of files. If it doesn't, use `pwd` to make sure you're in the right directory.
+ use `wc --help` to figure out what `wc` does
+ `wc -l BK.csv` and  `wc -l *.csv` -- what do you think the `*` does?
+ `head BK.csv` or `tail BK.csv` (what do `head` and `tail` do?)
+ what does `split` do? Split is incredibly useful if you find yourself in over your head. You can at least open a chunk of the data and figure out if it is even something you can work with. 
+ `split -l 5000 MN.csv Manhattan_chunks` 
+ Use `wc -l Manhattan*` to see the length of each. 
+ Play with tab completion. What happens if you just type Man<kbd>tab</kb>?
+ We actually don't need those, so do `ls Manhattan*` and see what that gets you, then do `rm Manhattan*` to delete the files. I always use `ls` as a sanity check when I'm about to delete files, especially when I'm using a regular expression to catch more than one file.
+ `du -h ./*.csv` -- this gives us the size of each of these files in `-h` a human readable format. So these are big files, even without the polygons. 


## Installing CSVkit 
So far, we've been using built-in shell commands. But I want everyone to do this `which pip` -- if you get a path like `/usr/bin/pip` that means that `pip` is on your computer. If you get an error or another command prompt, you must log in to a lab computer and we'll troubleshoot your computer later.

Then do `pip install --user csvkit` -- if you had admin privs on this machine you could install it everywhere, but the `--user` flag means you're only installing it for you.

+ csvcut -n BK.csv 

How many columns are there? 

If we only want to work with the following columns:

+ LandUse
+ OwnerType
+ ZoneDist
+ AssessTot
+ ExemptTot
+ Council
+ ZipCode
+ Address
+ CDTaxLotTaxBlock
+ XCoord
+ YCoord

What column numbers are we working with? 

+ LandUse **26**
+ OwnerType **28** (Try `csvcut -n BK.csv | grep Own`)
+ ZoneDist
+ AssessTot **55**
+ ExemptTot **57**
+ Council **8**
+ ZipCode **9**
+ Address **12**
+ CD **4**
+ Lot **3**
+ Block **2**
+ XCoord **72**
+ YCoord **73**

So let's check that:

`csvcut -c 26,28,55,57,8,9,12,4,3,2,72,73 MN.csv`

*Oh man oh man oh man, there's a ton of crap spewing down your screen like you're caught in the matrix!!*

That's cool. We can wait. 


`csvcut -c 26,28,55,57,8,9,12,4,3,2,72,73 MN.csv`

## Redirection

We're not going to go deep into this, but one of the nice things I can do at the command line is take the output of a command and, instead of writing it to `stdout` (aka the screen)

`csvcut -c 26,28,55,57,8,9,12,4,3,2,72,73 MN.csv | head`


`csvcut -c 26,28,55,57,8,9,12,4,3,2,72,73 MN.csv > smaller_MN.csv`

`csvcut -c 26,28,55,57,8,9,12,4,3,2,72,73 BX.csv > smaller_BX.csv`

`csvcut -c 26,28,55,57,8,9,12,4,3,2,72,73 SI.csv > smaller_SI.csv`

`csvcut -c 26,28,55,57,8,9,12,4,3,2,72,73 QN.csv > smaller_QN.csv`

`csvcut -c 26,28,55,57,8,9,12,4,3,2,72,73 BK.csv > smaller_BK.csv`

That is going to take a few minutes. That's okay.

Now try `du -h ./*.csv` -- we've already shrunk our files way, way down.

That's huge. These are now much, much more manageable files. And in this case, we are *only* interested in Vacant Land. From the data dictionary, I know that that's "LandUse" code 11. So we can use another command, `csvgrep` to find a pattern in the data: 

`csvcut -n smaller_MN.csv`

`csvgrep -c 1 -m 11 smaller_MN.csv > vacant_MN.csv`



##Stacking
Now, I actually used this:

`csvstack -g BK,BX,MN,QN,SI smaller_BK.csv smaller_BX.csv smaller_MN.csv smaller_QN.csv smaller_SI.csv > FiveBoro.csv` to get a single file for all five boros. 


And then I used grep to find the vacant lots: 
`csvcut -n FiveBoro.csv`

`csvgrep -c 2 -m 11 FiveBoro.csv > vacant_FiveBoro.csv`

## TK TK TK 
*LandUse: *Only 11 (vacant land)

*OwnerType:*
P (Private Ownership)
*BLANK* (possibly privately-owned)
I want to combine C, M, O, and X into another category, which is ownership
that's mixed or public

*ZoneDist*
I am primarily concerned with lots currently listed as
R1-1 - R10H (Residential)
M1-1/R5 - M1-6/R10 (Mixed Manufacturing and Residential)
*Then I want to combine all the other zoning categories: *
C1-6 - C8-4
M1-1 - M3-2
ZNA
ZR 11-151


## CSVkit

We're going to use a little Python program called [csvkit](http://csvkit.readthedocs.org)

`pip install --user csvkit`

## Experimenting
Using the complete 311 files on Baker


Use [`wc -l`](http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?wc) and `split` 

and `less -N` (or `=` while in `less`)

`head` and `tail`
