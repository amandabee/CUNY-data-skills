**Decide what to map**: identify a data set that you'd like to map. Add a post to [Tumblr](http://dataskills-class.tumblr.com/) by Friday night that includes the following:

+ A description of the data
+ The source of the data, with a link. 
+ Is this data points, shapes, or lines?
+ What geographic information do you need to map this? 
+ What do you need to do to combine data with geographic information?


Example:

> The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes _annual data on workplace fatalities, by state_. I'd like to create a map that shows the fatality rate per working adult, using _state by state employment data_ available from the St Louis Fed. This will be a map of shapes (the outline of each state) so I'll need to merge a US State shapefile with the fatality rate data. 

Or:

> The NYC Department of education recently released _data on high school sports budgets_. I'd like to create a map that shows where schools have substantial budgets. This will be a map of points (the location of each school). The DOE publishes a separate _data set that includes lat/lon for each school_ so I'll need to merge that data with the sports budgets data using "School Name" as the common field. 

Tag that post "map assignment"

**Make another map**: Once you've written up your Tumblr post, take a stab at actually making the map.  Your map is due Tuesday at 3PM.
