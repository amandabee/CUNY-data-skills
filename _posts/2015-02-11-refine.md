## Notes on Using Refine

Once you've installed [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/), you may see an error like "â€¦ is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash," [the solution](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/590) to is not at all intuitive: You have to Change your Privacy and Security settings to allow applications downloaded from "Anywhere" -- it's on the "general" tab. 

Refine runs a little server that you can access in your browser. It will always be at <http://127.0.0.1:3333> once it is running.

When you upload a file, you have to click "Create Project" in the top right to get started. You have a bunch of "parsing" options about how Refine should treat data. I haven't really plumbed those, but that should not stop you from doing so. 

## Louisiana
The state publishes a complete list of all 6844 [Statewide Public Officials](http://www.sos.la.gov/ElectionsAndVoting/FindPublicOfficials/Pages/default.aspx)
Download the data and pivot to get a count by "Office Title". You can see very quickly that there's kind of a problem.

So in refine, we'll clean it up.

+ Use the pull down next to `Office Title` and select `Facet > Text Facet`
+ Find the cluster button. Review, `Select All`, `Merge Selected and Re-Cluster`.
+ Why aren't there new matches? 
+ Look under `Edit Cells > Common transforms` and think about what "Trim whitespace" is likely to do. 
+ Cluster again. 
+ Try a new "Method" -- more matches, some of which aren't real overlaps. 
+ Re cluster for "City" and "City2"
+ Open a `Custom numeric facet...` for the "Commissioned Date" and see what `value.toDate().datePart("year")` does. 
+ Try splitting the zip code. 

Check out the [faceting documentation](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Faceting) for more insights.

Take a look at the undo/redo history -- you can create scripts to use over and over. 

## Keep Learning
If you want more practice with refine, you might find one of these tutorials helpful:

+ [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/) uses [Asian Development Bank work in Bangledesh](http://schoolofdata.org/courses/cleaning-iati-data-with-openrefine/), or [Provincial Hospitals in Zimbabwe](http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/recipes/cleaning-data-with-refine/)
+ [Enipedia](http://enipedia.tudelft.nl/wiki/OpenRefine_Tutorial) uses data on Universities from Wikipedia
+ [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine) uses museum collection metadata
+ [UC Berkeley](http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tutorials/cleaning-data/) has a data cleaning tutorial that just uses Excel.
