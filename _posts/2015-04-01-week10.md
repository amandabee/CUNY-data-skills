## Data Driven Stories
Rough Drafts for your data driven story are due April 22. So put some energy into making those shine. 

## Find Your Terminal
We are going to dig into some fun (I hope) command line tools for data analysis. So for your first step, I want you to either [install csvkit]({{ site.baseurl }}/hands-on/csvkit.html) or get through the beginning of [Learn Code the Hard Way]({{ site.baseurl }}/hands-on/csvkit.html). This shouldn't be a major undertaking. If you hit a wall or get frustrated, [file an issue](https://github.com/amandabee/CUNY-data-skills/issues) explaining how you got to where you are and what is frustrating.  Keep our guide to [asking good questions]({{ site.baseurl }}/hands-on/goodquestions.html) in mind. 

And then stop. Don't tear your hair out.
