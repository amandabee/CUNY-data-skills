All assignments are due by 3 PM the Tuesday before class.

I'm always accessible on Tuesdays until 3PM, so don't hestitate to ask for help. 

**Keep working** on your community profile. Incorporate the feedback you got in class today and revise it. 

**Clean More Data** with OpenRefine. Assignment TK. 

**Read** "Click here" is an easy fallback, but it usually means that it isn't obvious what a reader should do next. Look for an opportunity to make links and tabs more intuitive. Two good readings: 

+ [Website sins #1: Never say ‘Click here’](http://www.moghill.co.uk/wp/never-say-click-here-website-sins/) 
+ [Why Your Links Should Never Say “Click Here”](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/20/links-should-never-say-click-here/)

**Install** either [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) or [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) if you're a Windows user. 

**Read** [about choropleth maps](http://vis4.net/blog/posts/choropleth-maps/)
