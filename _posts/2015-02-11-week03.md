All assignments are due by 3 PM the Tuesday before class.

I'm always accessible on Tuesdays until 3PM, so don't hestitate to ask for help. 

**Keep working** on your community profile. Incorporate the feedback you got in class today and revise it. 

**Clean More Data** with OpenRefine.  Campaign Finance filings will win any "dirty data" contest. For Homework, you're going to pick a candidate who rean for office in New York City recently -- your City Council person is fine. The mayor is fine. Download their filings from the NYC [Campaign Finance Board Database](http://www.nyccfb.info/searchabledb/) and do some digging around. Or: toss me a different dirty data set that you'd like to take a stab at. 

Good examples of the kinds of stories you can write with data like this:  data, from *Gothamist* [Shady Groups Spend "Unprecedented" Amount Of Cash In Mayoral Election](http://gothamist.com/2013/09/16/shady_groups_spend_unprecedented_am.php) and from *The New York Times*, [Loophole in a Rule on Ad Spending](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/nyregion/loophole-in-a-rule-on-ad-spending.html), [Group Financed by Business Leaders Has Put Nearly $7 Million Into Council Races](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/nyregion/group-financed-by-business-leaders-has-put-nearly-7-million-into-council-races.html). The Times also built a nice interactive guide to [How Much the N.Y.C. Mayoral Candidates Have Raised and Spent](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/16/nyregion/how-much-the-nyc-mayoral-candidates-have-raised-and-spent.html) but they stopped updating it before the campaign season was over. 

**Read** "Click here" is an easy fallback, but it usually means that it isn't obvious what a reader should do next. Look for an opportunity to make links and tabs more intuitive. Two good readings: 

+ [Website sins #1: Never say ‘Click here’](http://www.moghill.co.uk/wp/never-say-click-here-website-sins/) 
+ [Why Your Links Should Never Say “Click Here”](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/20/links-should-never-say-click-here/)

**Install** either [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) or [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) if you're a Windows user. 

**Read** [about choropleth maps](http://vis4.net/blog/posts/choropleth-maps/) 

**Consider Reading** a few more map writings, including [When Maps Shouldn't Be Maps](http://www.ericson.net/content/2011/10/when-maps-shouldnt-be-maps/)

[![Heatmaps](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/heatmap.png)](http://xkcd.com/1138/)
