## Good datasets to pivot:

NYC's [Graduation Outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Borough-Classes-of-2005-2011-E/x2hp-8ukt) data from NYC Open Data.

Department of Environmental Conservation [data on gas wells](http://www.dec.ny.gov/energy/1603.html) in New York State. 

1. Start with `Data > Pivot Table Report` -- look at the cells Excel proposes to use. Does that include all of your data?
2. Add Row -- Use "COUNTY" for the rows. You should see a list of county names. 
3. Add Value -- Use "API_WELLNO" for now. 
4. Check the formula -- should excel `count` values or `sum` them? Or find an `average`? 

More things to play with:

* Try adding "SLANT" as a Column -- horizontal (as opposed to vertical) wells are particularly controversial. Are there any concentrations of horizontal wells?
* How would you work out how much money each county is collecting in permit fees?
* Can you see any trends in the average permit fee in each county? 


Fun fact: Excel isn't that special. I actually use [LibreOffice](http://libreoffice.org/) for all my spreadsheet and word processing needs. I like it much better than MS Office. And as a bonus, it is [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)!
